
# --- Usage Guide for Motor Vibration Diagnosis Model ---

# 1. PURPOSE:
# This Random Forest model diagnoses the health condition of an electric motor
# based on a small window of its 3-axis vibration data.
# It was trained on the SOON-pEMP dataset and achieved 93.75% accuracy on its test set.

# 2. REQUIRED FILES:
# - vibration_model.joblib (the trained model)
# - vibration_scaler.joblib (the data scaler)
# - vibration_label_encoder.joblib (the label encoder for decoding predictions)
# - vibration_model_features.json (the list of required input features)

# 3. INPUT:
# The model requires a pandas DataFrame where each row contains 24 features
# extracted from a window of raw vibration data (AccX, AccY, AccZ).
# The feature names are stored in 'vibration_model_features.json'.

# 4. EXAMPLE USAGE (PYTHON):
# import pandas as pd
# import joblib
# import json

# # Load the assets
# model = joblib.load('vibration_model.joblib')
# scaler = joblib.load('vibration_scaler.joblib')
# label_encoder = joblib.load('vibration_label_encoder.joblib')
# with open('vibration_model_features.json', 'r') as f:
#     model_features = json.load(f)

# # Create a sample input DataFrame (one row = one window of features)
# # In a real application, these values would come from your feature extraction function.
# sample_input = pd.DataFrame([{'AccX_mean': 297.0, 'AccX_std': 1774.1, 'AccX_rms': 1798.5, # ... and so on for all 24 features ... }])
# sample_input = sample_input.reindex(columns=model_features, fill_value=0) # Ensure correct column order

# # Scale the input features and make a prediction
# sample_input_scaled = scaler.transform(sample_input)
# prediction_encoded = model.predict(sample_input_scaled)
# prediction_label = label_encoder.inverse_transform(prediction_encoded)

# print(f"Predicted Motor Condition: {prediction_label[0]}")
