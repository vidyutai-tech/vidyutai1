# 1. PURPOSE:
# This XGBoost model predicts the future AC Power (kW) of a solar plant.
# The model was trained on data from Plant 1 and achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 238.03 kW on its test set.

# 2. REQUIRED FILES:
# - solar_forecast_model.json (the trained model)
# - solar_model_features.json (the list of required input features)

# 3. INPUT FEATURES:
# The model requires a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:
# ['AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE', 'MODULE_TEMPERATURE', 'IRRADIATION', 'HOUR', 'DAY_OF_WEEK', 'MONTH']

# 4. EXAMPLE USAGE (PYTHON):
# import pandas as pd
# import xgboost as xgb
# import json

# # Load the model and feature list
# forecast_model = xgb.XGBRegressor()
# forecast_model.load_model('solar_forecast_model.json')
# with open('solar_model_features.json', 'r') as f:
#     model_features = json.load(f)

# # Create a sample input DataFrame for one prediction
# # IMPORTANT: The columns must match the 'model_features' list
# sample_input = pd.DataFrame([{
#     'AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE': 25.0,
#     'MODULE_TEMPERATURE': 30.0,
#     'IRRADIATION': 0.5,
#     'HOUR': 13,
#     'DAY_OF_WEEK': 4, # Friday
#     'MONTH': 5 # May
# }])

# # Make a prediction
# # Ensure columns are in the same order as when the model was trained
# predicted_power = forecast_model.predict(sample_input[model_features])
# print(f"Predicted AC Power: {predicted_power[0]:.2f} kW")
